## Questions

-   What was the most challenging part?

    -   Working with the graph is I think challenging part. I have not worked with a graph previously. I will now explore more about the graph and how they work on a fundamental level.

-   What was the most fun part?

    -   I like to start the project from the stretch. I think the most fun part of the project is to setting up the project from the stretch, selecting the folder structure and style guide.

-   What do you think is wrong with this task or could be made better in this task?

    -   There is nothing wrong with the design in particular. But, I wanted to have less space between the elements, so that more elements in the same area.
